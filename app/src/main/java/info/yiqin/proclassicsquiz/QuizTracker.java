//QuizTracker follows the singleton pattern. Here's what you need to do to create a singleton
public class QuizTracker {

    //1. strictly encapsulate members by making them all private
    private int mCorrectAnswerNum = 0;
    private int mIncorrectAnswerNum = 0;
    private String mName;
    private int mQuestionNum;
    //2. provide a static member of the same type of the enclosing class
    private  static QuizTracker sQuizTracker;

    //3. override its default constructor (remember that by default, Java provides a no-arg contractor)
    // and make it private. No one outside this class can instantiate it now.
    private QuizTracker(){}

    //4. provide a static getInstance() method. In this case, we don't instantiate until getInstance() is called for the first time (also know as lazy initialization)
    //All subsequent calls to getInstance() will return a reference to the already-instantiated sQuizTracker object. With this technique we can guarantee that
    //there is only ever one instance of this object, no matter how many times we call getInstance(). Because it is static, sQuizTracker it will persist in memory space throughout
    // the entire lifecycle of the app and accessible to any first-order component (e.g. Activity).

    //5. Activity members are often flushed -- for example in the event of a bounce.  Notice that QuizTracker is nowhere a member of any Activity.
